Every day when I come back home guojia always pretends to be dead.

When I get home, my wife always pretends to be dead.
What makes it happen ?

When I got home, she was lying down on the entrance.
At the beginning, I was surprised. But it was continued everyday, I got used to it, and became ignoring her with saying “Hey, wake up”.

Then, blood was coming out of her mouth in next day.
One week after, she was wearing blood-soaked shirt.

I don’t know if she is lately running out of ideas or getting crazy.
But, one day, an arrow was piercing her head. The other day, she was putting a plastic bag on her head (it was apparently waving with her breath).
She was wearing a military dress and had an honorable death in battle with holding a gun yesterday.

Of course, I always go past her.

What she wants me to do ?
Where is she going?
I haven’t got a clue. Please tell me why.

One day, she was fixing supper with leaving an arrow piercing her head.
